                <p>
                    A wet market is a market selling fresh meat and produce,
                    distinguished from dry markets which sell durable goods such as cloth and electronics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wet markets were traditionally places that sold live animals out in the open.
                    This includes poultry, fish, reptiles, and pigs. However, since SARS,
                    large animals and poultry are not as commonly found in the markets in Hong Kong,
                    though live fish, shellfish, and frogs are widely available.
                    Some markets also sell exotic animals. Fresh fruits and vegetables are also available.
                    Wet markets also generally include butcher shops with fresh meat.

        <h2>German Flea Market</h2>
        <p>
            A flea market (or swap meet) is a type of bazaar that rents space to people who want to sell or barter merchandise.
            Used goods, low quality items, and high quality items such as collectibles and antiques are commonly sold.
            Many markets offer fresh produce or baked goods, plants from local farms and vintage clothes.
            Renters of the flea market tables are called vendors.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may be indoors, as in a warehouse or school gymnasium; or outdoors, as in a field or parking lot or under a tent.
            Flea markets can be held annually or semiannually, others may be conducted monthly, on weekends, or daily.
            Flea-market vendors may range from a family that is renting a table for the first time to sell a few unwanted household items,
            to scouts who rove the region buying items for sale from garage sales and other flea markets, and several staff watching the stalls.
